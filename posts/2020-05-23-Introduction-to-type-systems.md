# Introduction

In this series, I will explain various type systems and their implementations in Haskell.
The aim for this series is to be an approachable way to learn about type systems.
I will try to cover both the theoretical aspects, such as formal (mathematical) notation, and the practical aspects, consisting of a Haskell implementation.
After reading this series, you should have an understanding of the basics of type systems.
