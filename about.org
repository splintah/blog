title: About
---

I am doing a double bachelor study of mathematics and computing
science at the [[https://ru.nl/][Radboud Universiteit]] in Nijmegen and I'm working as a
Haskell developer at [[https://channable.com][Channable]].

I'm interested in functional programming with [[https://haskell.org/][Haskell]], type systems
and type theory, compiler construction and formal verification using
[[https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php][Agda]].
