title: About
---

I'm currently in the final year of secondary school in the
Netherlands. Next year, I will be starting a double bachelor study of
mathematics and computing science at the [[https://ru.nl/][Radboud Universiteit]] in
Nijmegen.

I'm interested in functional programming with [[https://haskell.org/][Haskell]], type systems
and type theory, compiler construction and formal verification using
[[https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php][Agda]].
